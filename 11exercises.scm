; Applicative: the interpreter will attempt to evaluate (p) as an operand before applying the procedure, and it won't know what to do

; Normal-order: the interpreter would simply sub in 0 and (p) and, since the first condition in the if statement will be true, it will return 0 as (p) won't matter

;; *1.6*

; After testing it out, it gets stuck in an infinite loop. If statements are special in that they evaluate either the then or else clauses...with the new-if function though, scheme will try and evaluate the else statement regardless of whether the predicate's conditions are met. So it will just keep running sqrt-iter over and over

(define (sqrt-iter guess x) ;to be repeatedly called until guess is 'good enough' as defined below
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))

(define (improve guess x) ;to gradually improve the guess via successive approximations
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y) ;to find average of guess and previous guess
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess x) ;to test whether the guess is accurate enough
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (sqrt x) ;to start the sqrt-iter 'loop', with an initial guess of 1
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

(sqrt 0.000001)
;should be 0.001, but scheme returns 0.031260655525445276, as our definition of 'good-enough' is too imprecise for a number this small.

(sqrt 10000000000000)
;should be 3162277.660..., however, scheme gets stuck in a loop. I believe this is because it hits a point where it alternates between two guesses that aren't 'good enough'.

; Alternate strategy:
