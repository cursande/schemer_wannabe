;; Exercise 1.39. A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published
;; in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:where x is in radians.

;; Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an approximation to the tangent function based on
;; Lambertâ€™s formula. K specifies the number of terms to compute, as in exercise 1.37.
